    <div><p class="centered">What am I supposed to be looking at here?</p>
      <p>I see a green rectangle beside a blue round thing. And they're hanging on the wall in a world famous museum. Hmm, perhaps the title will help me get it... nope, it's just called "Green Blue".</div>
    <p>Well, even if you happen to love this kind of stuff, there's no doubt you've questioned why artists create the way they do, or how they can be highly celebrated for something so transparently effortless. It's no secret that artists tend to make things which aren't easily understood, and in the realms of abstract (or non-representational) art, it's especially hard to understand paintings as seemingly basic as Ellsworth Kelly's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/arts/design/ellsworth-kelly-last-paintings.html">Diptych: Green Blue</a>.
  Comments you might hear in a disucssion about this kind of art is "my kid could've done that!", "it's all a scam" or "what a talentless hack". Still, where one might just see a plain red canvas, others see the spectacular. After Kelly's death in 2015, senior art critic of New York Magazine, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/12/ellsworth-kelly-1923-2015.html">Jerry Saltz wrote this</a> on Kelly's legacy:</p>
  <div class="textBox">He gives permission to just love color, prettiness, the miracle of chromatic intensities — for themselves and the sensations that seem inherent, internal, part of form itself. It’s hard to overstate just how radical this prettiness is when it comes to modernism and the ways it often comes with backstory, theory, rationale. Kelly makes us revel in something as simple as a large monochrome floating painting and see it not only as a crack into meaning, but also as something that has attained an almost inviolate foreverness.</div>
<p>So what does it all mean? Why would an artist commit his life to painting solid colors if there isn't some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/oct/29/art-meaning-bob-dylan">deeper meaning</a>? The answer to this might (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-revolution-ugly-design-upending-conventions-beauty">but not always</a>) have something to do with <span class="highlight becauseBeauty"><i>beauty</i></span>.</p>
<p>But where does this elusive beauty come from? And why does it sometimes look like it was <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/jackson-pollock" target="_blank">created by accident?</a> Does art need to be <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wd_32L6e-w">beautiful to be valuable</a>? And if a piece of art is not depicting something real, who's to say what's good and what isn't?
There are many answers to these questions. And interestingly, it seems like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/12/arts/art-is-it-art-is-it-good-and-who-says-so.html">every artist has their own take</a>.</p>
<p>The topic I want to focus on in this curation involves non-representational art that aims to be beautiful, and how nature informs our idea of what about it is aesthetically exciting. I want to highlight how successful abstract compositions often imitate forms seen in nature, and in a way, depict a kind of natural beauty.</p>

<div class="cummings">
<h2 class="textTitle">E.E. Cummings - l(a</h2>
<div class="textBox cummingsBox"><pre id="precummings">
l(a

le

s)

l

iness</pre></div>

    <p>Here we have a poem made of groups of vertically arranged letters. If we remove the paragraph breaks, it reads: <span><pre class="precummings2">l(a le af fa ll s) one l iness</pre></span>
      <p>it's the phrase "a leaf falls" inserted between the word "loneliness". The placement of this insertion separates "oneliness" from its l, which looks like the number 1.
      The double l in "falls" is given its own line, and contrasts the lonely "one l" on lines 10 and 11.
    The negative space that separates the fragments of each word acts as a visual representation of the emotion of loneliness. Also of note, each cluster of letters alternates from consonants to vowels. The vertical composition, and clever placement of parentheses indicate an image of a solitary leaf tumbling to the ground.
Cummings uses the likeness of a natural phenomenon to guide an abstract work. Another Cummings poem, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.umass.edu/wsp/lectures/translation/learning/cummings.html">!blac</a>, is arranged in a similar way, and also features the image of a falling leaf.</p>
    <p>L(a is one of my favorite poems because it uses words as a visual medium. Similar to abstract painting, its emotional content is contained within the composition of its form. It seems almost like nonsense at first, but unpacking its elements reveals a neat package of meaning. According to biographer Richard S. Kennedy, l(a is  "the most delicately beautiful literary construct that Cummings ever created". It's really the quintessential Cummings poem.</p>

          <p>Music, without words, is an inherently abstract art form. My second text is this 1905 piano composition by Claude Debussy (visuals by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.musanim.com/index.html">Stephen Malinowski</a>). Both the Cummings poem and this song depict a scene in nature, but Reflets Dans L'eau (reflections in water) offers a different perspective. James Boyk, the pianist who performed the above recording, wrote "It has no protagonist. It is not about a person's hopes, struggles or triumphs, nor about a relation with God. It is a picture, simply, of Nature. No human is present except as observer." Instead of using an aspect of nature as a symbol for a human experience, Debussy attempts to portray a part of nature through music, revealing an intrinsic beauty.</p>
          <p>In my opinion, Debussy was successful at this. Just listen to it! It sounds exactly like an light on a pond. The experience he creates feels much like looking at Claude Monét's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16568/water-lilies">Water Lilies</a>. It's varied sense of time is like the motion of a body of water. It's fluid, non-linear, in constant flux from agitation to stillness. Some parts sound like splashes and their resulting ripples, and other parts come to rest like calm waves, to be interrupted once again. The unusual harmonic colors shimmer like a playful warping picture. It has this precise ambguity about it that I struggle to explain. It sounds exotic and familiar, it's dissonant and perfect. In my opinion, it's one of the most effective depictions of the beauty of nature. It's delicious.</p></div>

      <h2 class="textTitle escher">MC Escher - Smaller and Smaller</h2>
      <div class="imgContainer"><img class="topImg" src="img/smallerandsmaller.jpg" alt=""></div>

      <p>Dutch artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher">MC Escher</a> is famous for his mathematical, and illusionary style. This 1956 work, Smaller and Smaller, is a print created with <a href="http://mathstat.slu.edu/escher/upload/3/3f/Escher-woodblock2.jpg">a carved woodcut block</a>. Compared to his previous linear <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/bird-fish">tesselations</a>, Escher was experimenting with a concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_tilings_in_hyperbolic_plane">Hyperbolic tiling</a> as a way to project his designs into an infinite space. In this composition, a tesselation of interloocking lizards enxtends infinitely into the center of the plane. In 1964, Escher did the reverse of this with <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/square-limit">Square Limi, </a>where the tiling hyperbolically collects at the edges of the composition rather than the center.</p>

        <p>To achieve this optical effect, Escher used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">fractal geometry</a>. Fractals are shapes that have self-similarity, meaning the larger design contains patterns that recur as you zoom in, making them theoretically infinite in detail. If you study the pattern of Smaller and Smaller, you'll see that inner design contains <a href="http://mathstat.slu.edu/escher/upload/9/97/Smaller-and-smaller-self-similarity.jpg">smaller copies of itself</a>.

          <p>Despite their recent discovery in mathetmatics, fractals have been an inspiration for artists for centuries (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.academia.edu/347639/Hindu_Temple_Fractals">Hindu Temples</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_geometric_patterns">Islamic geometric patterns</a>).
The <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch Snowflake</a>, as seen below, is a simple fractal shape, was one of the first that was discovered.<div class="imgContainer"><img class="snowflake" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Von_Koch_curve.gif" alt="Von Koch curve.gif">
      </div>
        <p>Fractals are especially useful for mathematically describing the complex "roughness" of naturally occuring things. They exist in everything big and small. From microscopic bacteria, to organs in the human body, to plant growth, geographic formations, and celestial bodies.</p>

        <div class="imgContainer"><img src="img/trees.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div class="imgContainer"><img src="img/Lake_Nasser.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p>Because of their omnipresence in nature, they're a powerful tool for artists as well. Man-made objects tend to be simple, finite, and made of simple shapes. Artistic processes that use fractal geometry can enable us to create abstractions that mimic nature, and are seemingly endlessly complex. Fractal processes have been used in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256057394_Fractals_in_architecture">architecture</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4115525/">music</a>, and even <a href="http://litrefsarticles.blogspot.com/2011/07/fractals-and-poetry.html">poetry</a>.</p>

    <div class="Andy Goldsworthy">
      <h2 class="textTitle goldsworthy">Andy Goldsworthy - Rivers and Tides</h2>

      <p>Perhaps the most direct example of art being informed by nature is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STW0eZDsKVg">Land Art</a>. Land Artists use the natural materials of a landscape to create their works. They often only exist in galleries as photographs, and usually only existed temporarily. My favorite example of Land Art is the work Andy Goldsworthy.</p>

      <div class="imgContainer"><img src="img/andy.jpeg" alt=""></div>

      <p>Goldsworthy uses natural materials such as leaves, soil, rocks, wood, and ice, to create spectacular compositions. His minute attention to detail makes it seem like his work occured naturally, without human interference.</p>

      <div class="imgContainer"><img src="img/andy6.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <div class="imgContainer"><img src="img/andy2.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <div class="imgContainer"><img src="img/andy3.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <div class="imgContainer"><img src="img/andy4.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <div class="imgContainer"><img src="img/andy5.jpg" alt=""></div>

      <p>In 2001, film director Thomas Riedelsheimer documented Goldsworthy's creative process for over a year, resulting in the film "Rivers and Tides". It's a rare glimpse into the Goldsworthy's life, you can really see how passionate he is about his work, despite its ephemeral nature. Plus, he has some really interestig philosophical outlook on life. I highly recommend this movie, it's availble for free on YouTube below.</p>

      <p>If you enjoyed that movie, the same director reunited with Andy last year to create a follow-up documentary, <a href="https://www.leaningintothewindfilm.com">Leaning Into the Wind</a>. You have to pay to watch this one, but it's definitely mworth it.</p>

    <div class="conclusion">
      <h3 class="subheading textTitle"></h3>
      <p>To me, one of the best qualities of abstract art is its ability to make the invisible visible, or to show us something we can't put into words. Referring again to Ellsworth Kelly, his art might seem artificially simple, but he was actually heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.artspace.com/magazine/interviews_features/video/ellsworth-kelly-video-part-1-53364">observations of the natural world</a> around him. The world from Kelly presents, reveals nature's beauty in its most simplified form. Just as much as nature can be described by infinite mathematics, the world can also be broken down into colors and shapes.</p>
